# geminabox-ng

Opinionated Cookbook to install and Configure [Gem in a Box](https://github.com/geminabox/geminabox)

Largely inspired by previous versions:

* https://github.com/aforward-obsolete/chef-geminabox
* https://github.com/chrisroberts/cookbook-geminabox
* https://github.com/reset/geminabox-cookbook

And modernized, using [ruby_rbenv](https://github.com/sous-chefs/ruby_rbenv) and [poise-service](https://github.com/poise/poise-service)
